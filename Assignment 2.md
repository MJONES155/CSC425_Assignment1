College students with campus dining meal plans

Problem Description: 

Some college students struggle to make sure they are using their meal plan budget efficiently. This is especially true when they are unable to see how the purchases they are making impact that budget.

Evidence of the Problem: 

The average college meal plan costs about $5,600 per year, and nearly all first-year students are required to purchase one, leaving little flexibility or refunds for unused portions (Education Loan Finance [ELFI], 2025; Clifford, 2024).

A scoping review published in Public Health Nutrition found that approximately 43% of U.S. college students experience food insecurity, even among those with prepaid meal plans (Nikolaus, Ellison, & Nickols-Richardson, 2019, via NIH PubMed Central).

In a separate study, a student expressed frustration about budgeting her meal credits, saying:
“You shouldn’t eat chips as a meal, but when you have nothing else to do, you eat just water and chips” — highlighting how inflexible meal plan structures and budgeting constraints limit healthy food choices (Raskind et al., 2019, via NIH PubMed Central).

User Persona
Name: Jane Doe
Age: 21
Occupation: Student
Location: Murray, KY
Goals: To complete college with as little debt as possible.
Frustrations: Having a hard time balancing what they want to eat while being on a college budget.
Technology Comfort Level: Moderate (able to use smartphone, computer, and applications)

Ethical Lens Applied
Principle: Equity in access to essential resources / Assisting with life skills
● Application: Lack of clarity around meal-plan usage disproportionately burdens students with tight budgets, potentially harming their health and academics. A budgeting tool mitigates inequities as well as gives students the tools to succeed.
● Stakeholders Impacted: Meal-plan students, campus dining facilities, college administration
● Professional Standard: Supports ACM Code of Ethics 3.1: “Ensure that the public good is the central concern,” by prioritizing equitable food access and financial well-being for students.
