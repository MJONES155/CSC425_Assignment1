Target User Group
International College Students
Young adults adjusting to new cultural, academic, and professional systems. Many are balancing academics,work and also face language and cultural barriers.

Problem Description
International students frequently experience social isolation, uncertainty about academic expectations, and confusion navigating work/visa restrictions. Without a centralized resource, they struggle to find reliable guidance, build peer support networks, and access opportunities. These barriers contribute to stress, loneliness, and academic or professional setbacks.

Evidence of the Problem
“ By the end of the second month, my enthusiasm had literally died. I felt quite isolated. Like everyone else, I started searching for fellow Indians in my class and on campus. Skepticism had set in. I was not sure if I could adjust in the new environment.” —Moshmi Sanagavarapu, international graduate student from India


According to NAFSA (2020) Even before the pandemic, international students reported feeling lonely and isolated; almost 1 in 4 international students in our study (24 percent) feel they have not been accepted socially.


According to the Institute of International Education, statistics on international students show that about 20% fund their education in the U.S. through current employment.


“How Might We” Statement
How might we help international students build social connections and access resources to navigate academic, cultural, and work challenges more easily?
