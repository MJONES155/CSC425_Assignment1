CSC425 Deliverable 2: User Research & Problem Definition Submission Template

Student Name: Emilia Kubik
Branch Name: D2-EmiliaKubik
Date Submitted: August 29, 2025

Target User Group: 
Neurodivergent adults
Adults with ADHD, autism, or other neurodivergent traits who are in school/working and struggle to stay focused or manage their time. 

Problem Description
Many neurodivergent adults struggle to stay on task or work efficiently. There are tools out there meant for productivity, but they are all designed assuming that the user can plan linearly and execute consistently. For neurodivergent individuals, these tools can often be overwhelming and ultimately ineffective. This leads to further frustration, missed deadlines, and feelings of failure.

Evidence of the Problem
“The ADHD brain may favor tasks that offer novelty and stimulation and avoid those considered repetitive and boring. Hence, understimulated ADHD often makes it hard to stay on track with some activities and chores” add.org 
“Over 60% of all autistic adults—including roughly 2 million with college degrees—struggle to obtain and keep employment.” today.umd.edu
Reddit post: “I’ve tried every productivity app… and still feel like I’m failing. Anyone else?” reddit.com

“How Might We” Statement
How might we design a productivity tool that adapts to neurodivergent needs by offering flexible structure, emotional support, and sensory-friendly design?
